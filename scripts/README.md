These are examples for using the C++ API of dReal. For SMT formulas or hybrid system examples, please check the ../benchmarks directory. 

To use the C++ API, you'll need to link with the dynamic library (the prebuilt ones can be found in the releases) and include the following two header files: 
- The "dreal.hh" file in the src/api directory. 
- The "config.h" file in the build directory (after compiling).
